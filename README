README for Net::MemcacheQ
=========================

Net::MemcacheQ is a very basic client wrapper around IO::Socket::INET
designed to speak a subset of the MemcacheQ protocol as described at
http://memcachedb.org/memcacheq/

Motivation for this was the fact that there didnt seem to be anything
on CPAN directly related to MemcacheQ with few dependencies, except
possibly things relating to memcached, none of which explicitly state
whether they work with memcacheq or not.
